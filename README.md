# Caesar-cipher
The program applies the Caesar cipher encryption technique to a frase written by the user using the key obtained in the same way.

The user should do the following:
  1. Write a frase containing any number of characters, then press enter
  2. Chose the key by inputing an integer
  3. If the user fails to do so the program will output an error message and will go back to step one.

The program will display the encrypted frase in the console.
